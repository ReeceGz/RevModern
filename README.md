# RevModern

This repository contains the RevCMS source code. Before running the application you must configure your site settings.

1. Copy `app/management/config.php.example` to `app/management/config.php`.
2. Edit `config.php` and replace the placeholder values with your database credentials and other hotel information.

After configuration you can point your web server to `index.php` and start the CMS.
